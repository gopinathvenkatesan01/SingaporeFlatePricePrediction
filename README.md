**Introduction**

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application that predicts the resale prices of flats in Singapore. This predictive model will be based on historical data of resale flat transactions, and it aims to assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.

The resale flat market in Singapore is highly competitive, and it can be challenging to accurately estimate the resale value of a flat. There are many factors that can affect resale prices, such as location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration. A predictive model can help to overcome these challenges by providing users with an estimated resale price based on these factors.

**Features**

**Data Preprocessing**
- **Data Understanding :** Before embarking on modeling, it's essential to thoroughly comprehend your dataset. Begin by categorizing the variables, distinguishing between continuous and categorical ones, and examining their distributions. Within our dataset, it's important to address potential issues such as 'Remaing_Lease' values starting with '00000,' which should be converted to null to enhance data integrity.
- **Handling Null Values:** In our dataset, addressing missing values is critical. Depending on the nature of the data and the specific feature, we may opt for imputation methods such as mean, median, or mode to handle these null values effectively.
- **Encoding and Data Type Conversion:** When preparing categorical features for modeling, we utilize ordinal encoding. This method converts categorical values into numerical representations that reflect their inherent order and relationship with the target variable. Additionally, it's crucial to ensure that all data types are appropriately converted to meet the modeling requirements.
- **Skewness - Feature Scaling:** Skewness is a common challenge in datasets. Identifying skewness in the data is essential, and appropriate data transformations must be applied to mitigate it. One widely-used method is the log transformation, which is particularly effective in addressing high skewness in continuous variables. This transformation helps achieve a more balanced and normally-distributed dataset, which is often a prerequisite for many machine learning algorithms.
- **Outliers Handling:** Outliers have the potential to greatly influence model accuracy. To address outliers in our dataset, we employ the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. This approach entails identifying data points that lie outside the boundaries defined by the IQR and subsequently adjusting them to values that better align with the majority of the data. By applying this technique, we aim to enhance the robustness and reliability of our model predictions.
- **Wrong Date Handling:** When encountering cases where delivery dates precede item dates in our dataset, we address this issue by calculating the time difference between them. This difference is then utilized to train a Random Forest Regressor model, allowing us to predict the corrected delivery date accurately. By implementing this approach, we ensure that our dataset maintains both integrity and accuracy, facilitating more reliable predictions in our analyses.
